# JavaScript Variables

## Overview
In this lesson, we'll introduce JavaScript variables and explain how to declare, assign, and access them.

## Objectives
1. Understand what a variable is.
2. Describe how to name variables in JavaScript.
3. Use `var` to create and access variables in pre-ES2015 code.
4. Explain the basics of the variable lifecycle — the distinct declaration and assignment phases.
5. Define when to use `const`, `let`, and `var` for declaring variables.

## What is a variable?
A variable is a container in which we can store values for later retrieval.

Imagine a box that can hold any type of data: a number, string, boolean, object — even an `undefined`. We take some data that we want to store, place it inside the box, and hand the box off to the JavaScript engine, which stores it in memory. All done! Our data is safely cached until we need to access it again.

But wait! When we ask for the data back, how will the JavaScript engine know _which_ box to retrieve? We need to assign a name to our variable — a label for our box — so that we can tell the engine exactly which piece of stored data we want to access.

## Naming variables
There are a number of complicated rules governing valid variable names in JavaScript. For almost every situation, follow these three rules, and you'll be fine:
- Start every variable name with a lowercase letter. Variable names starting with a number are not valid.
- Don't use spaces — `camelCaseYourVariableNames` instead of `snake_casing_them`.
- Don't use JavaScript [reserved words][reserved words] or [future reserved words][future reserved words].

It's important to note that case matters, so `javaScript`, `javascript`, `JavaScript`, and `JAVASCRIPT` are four different variables.

## Initializing variables
The `var` reserved word is the classic way to declare a variable. It's been around since the inception of JavaScript, and it's what you will encounter in any pre-ES2015 code.

Creating new variables in JavaScript is really a two-step process. First, we declare the variable...
```js
var pi;
//=> undefined
```

...and the JavaScript engine sets aside a chunk of memory to store the declared variable. Then, we assign a value to that variable:
```js
pi = 3.14159;
//=> 3.14159
```

We can package both of the initialization steps — declaration and assignment — in a single line of code:
```js
var pi = 3.14159;
//=> undefined
```

## Retrieving variables
To retrieve a declared variable, simply refer to its name:
```js
pi;
//=> 3.14159
```

## Variable values
Upon declaration, all variables are automatically assigned the value of `undefined`. It's only after we assign a new value that the variable will contain something other than undefined. We can use the `typeof` operator to check the data type of the value currently stored in a variable:
```js
var language;
//=> undefined

typeof language;
//=> "undefined"

language = "JavaScript";
//=> "JavaScript"

typeof language;
//=> "string"
```

***Top Tip***: When writing JavaScript code, it's good practice to ***never*** set a variable equal to `undefined`. Variables will be `undefined` until we explicitly assign a value, so encountering an `undefined` variable is a strong signal that the variable was declared but not assigned prior to the reference. That's valuable information that we can use while debugging, and it comes at no additional cost to us.

Once a variable has been created with `var`, we can reassign it to our heart's content:
```js
var pi = 3.14159;
//=> undefined

typeof pi;
//=> "number"

pi = "the ratio between a circle's circumference and diameter";
//=> "the ratio between a circle's circumference and diameter"

typeof pi;
//=> "string"
```

The data that's stored in our variable might change over time, but at any moment we can retrieve its current contents:
```js
var language = "Mocha";
//=> undefined

language = "LiveScript";
//=> "LiveScript";

language = "JavaScript";
//=> "JavaScript";

language;
//=> "JavaScript";
```

## Beyond `var`
Because of its ubiquity in legacy code and StackOverflow posts, it's important to get to know `var`. However, as we alluded to earlier, there is almost no reason to use `var` in a post-ES2015 world. `var` comes with a ton of baggage in the form of scope issues — which we will discuss in the lesson on scope in JavaScript — and by allowing developers to play a little too fast and loose with variable declarations.

With `var`, no error is thrown if you declare a variable twice:
```js
var language = "Ruby";
//=> undefined

var language = "JavaScript";
//=> undefined

language;
//=> "JavaScript"
```

This is bad! There's no reason to declare a variable twice, and it's usually a mistake by a developer unaware that the variable had already been declared.

### `let`: the new `var`
ES2015 introduced two new ways to create variables: `let` and `const`. Both solve all of `var`'s scope issues, which, again, we'll cover in the lesson on scope in JavaScript. Both also throw an error if you try to declare the same variable a second time:
```js
let pi = 3.14159;
//=> undefined

let pi = "the ratio between a circle's circumference and diameter";
//=> Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'pi' has already been declared
```

Just like with `var`, we can still reassign a variable declared with `let`:
```js
let pi = 3.14159;
//=> undefined

pi = "the ratio between a circle's circumference and diameter";
//=> "the ratio between a circle's circumference and diameter"

typeof pi;
//=> "string"
```

### "Imma `let` you finish, but `const` is the best way to declare variables of all time"
![Kanye](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17556281/28677639-21dd517e-72bc-11e7-9759-f8f2f69d34e0.gif)

Using `let` instead of `var` will help you avoid silly errors like declaring the same variable at two different places within your code, but there's an even better option to use as your default: `const`.

Declaring a variable with the `const` reserved word means that not only can it not be redeclared but it also ***cannot be reassigned***. This is a good thing for three reasons:
1. When we assign a primitive value (any type of data _except_ an object) to a variable declared with `const`, we know that variable will _always_ contain the same value.
2. When we assign an object to a variable declared with `const`, we know that variable will _always_ point to the same object (though the object's properties can still be modified — more on this in the lesson about objects in JavaScript).
3. When another developer looks at our code and sees a `const` declaration, they immediately know that variable points to the same object or has the same value every other time it's referenced in the program. For variables declared with `let` or `var`, the developer cannot be so sure and will have to keep track of how those variables change throughout the program. The extra information provided by `const` is valuable, and it comes at no extra cost to you! Just use `const` as much as possible and reap the benefits.

```js
const pi = 3.14159;
//=> undefined

pi = 2.71828;
//=> Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```

***NOTE***: With `let`, it's possible to declare a variable without assigning a value, just like `var`:
```js
let pi;
//=> undefined

pi = 3.14159;
//=> 3.14159
```

However, because `const` doesn't allow reassignment after the variable is initialized, we **must** assign a value right away:
```js
const pi;
//=> Uncaught SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration

const pi = 3.14159;
//=> undefined
```

## Handy reference on when to use `const` vs. `let` vs. `var`
As your JavaScript powers increase with experience, you'll develop a more nuanced understanding of what to use where. However, for now, this is a good rule of thumb:
- ***Use `var`...*** never.
- ***Use `let`...*** when you know the value of a variable will change. For example, a `counter` variable that starts at `0` and is subsequently incremented to `1`, `2`, `3`, and so on. In the lessons on looping and iteration in JavaScript, `let` will have its moment in the spotlight.
- ***Use `const`...*** for _every_ other variable.

Best practice is to always declare variables with `const` and then, if you later realize that the value has to change over the course of your program, circle back to change it to `let`.
